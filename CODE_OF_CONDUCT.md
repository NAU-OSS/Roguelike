# Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders of the Roguelike project pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, caste, color, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Our Values

The Roguelike community is built on a few core principles that guide everything we do:

**Openness.** We welcome contributors of all backgrounds and experience levels. A first-time open source contributor deserves the same respect as a seasoned developer. The dungeon is open to everyone.

**Collaboration over competition.** We are all building something together. Credit is shared, ideas are discussed openly, and decisions are made transparently. No single contributor owns the project — we all do.

**Respect for the craft.** We take the code, the documentation, and the community seriously. We give thoughtful feedback, write meaningful commit messages, and treat every contribution — however small — as something worth caring about.

**Learning by doing.** Mistakes happen. What matters is how we respond to them. We encourage experimentation, expect some failure, and grow together through both.

## Expected Behavior

The following behaviors are expected of all community members across all project spaces, including GitHub Issues, Pull Requests, code reviews, and any other channels associated with this project:

- Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people
- Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
- Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
- Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes, and learning from the experience
- Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the overall community
- Using welcoming and inclusive language
- Being patient — maintainers and contributors are volunteers with limited time

---

## Unacceptable Behavior

The following behaviors are considered unacceptable and will not be tolerated:

- The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or advances of any kind
- Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- Public or private harassment of any kind
- Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email address, without their explicit permission (doxxing)
- Dismissing or belittling contributions based on a person's experience level, background, or identity
- Sustained disruption of discussions, issues, or pull requests
- Deliberately intimidating or creating a hostile environment for others
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## How to Report Violations

If you experience or witness behavior that violates this Code of Conduct, please report it promptly. All reports will be handled with discretion and confidentiality.

**To report a violation:**

- **GitHub Issues (non-urgent):** Open a private issue or contact the maintainer directly via GitHub at [@rmwood0908](https://github.com/rmwood0908).
- **Direct contact:** If the situation is sensitive or involves a maintainer, reach out privately through GitHub's messaging features.

When reporting, please include:

- Your contact information
- A description of the incident, including what was said or done
- The date, time, and location (e.g., which GitHub issue or PR thread)
- Any additional context or evidence you believe is relevant

All community members are obligated to respect the privacy and safety of anyone who reports a violation. Retaliation against anyone who makes a good-faith report is itself a violation of this Code of Conduct.

## Enforcement Guidelines

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing the standards of acceptable behavior. They will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned with this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate.

Enforcement will follow these four levels, based on the Contributor Covenant's Community Impact Guidelines:

### 1. Correction

**Community Impact:** Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed unprofessional or unwelcome.

**Consequence:** A private, written warning from community leaders, explaining the nature of the violation and why the behavior was inappropriate. A public apology may be requested.

### 2. Warning

**Community Impact:** A violation through a single incident or a series of actions.

**Consequence:** A formal warning with consequences for continued behavior. The individual will be asked to have no interaction with the people involved — including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct — for a specified period of time. Violating these terms may lead to a temporary or permanent ban.

### 3. Temporary Ban

**Community Impact:** A serious violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior.

**Consequence:** A temporary ban from any kind of interaction or public communication within the community for a specified period of time. No public or private interaction with the people involved is permitted during this period. Violating these terms may lead to a permanent ban.

### 4. Permanent Ban

**Community Impact:** Demonstrating a pattern of violating community standards, including sustained harassment, aggression toward individuals, or targeted harm against classes of people.

**Consequence:** A permanent ban from all community interaction.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces associated with the Roguelike project, including the GitHub repository, Issues, Pull Requests, and any other official communication channels. It also applies when an individual is officially representing the project in public spaces — for example, using an official project email address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as a representative at an event.
